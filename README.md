# Data Structures

## Getting started
1. Clone down this repo
2. Open a `SpecRunner.html` file in your browser
3. Make the tests turn green

### BONUS:
1. Create these data structures without using `class` syntax. Look into JavaScript inheritance and design patterns.
2. Figure out the time and memory complexity of each of the methods on the data structures you write (look into `big O` - http://bigocheatsheet.com/). Can you get your methods to be faster and/or use less memory?
